Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /opt/tmp/tmp/matplotlib-8zrav20z because the default path (/home/vlecoz/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
2023-05-08 22:48:07,782 - distributed.core - INFO - Event loop was unresponsive in Worker for 9.66s.  This is often caused by long-running GIL-holding functions or moving large chunks of data. This can cause timeouts and instability.
